## Technical Page
Here is another one of my old projects. I rebuilt the Wikipedia page for JavaScript and tried to code a11y semantics into the HTML as best possible. I believe this was for The Odin Project. There are almost 800 lines of HTML for this project...what was I thinking!? In hindsight, I should have built some things differently (ie. build for mobile first) and maybe not take on such an ambitious article/task. Overall, it was fun and insightful and I rather enjoy the softness of the design.
